                    Abstract:<br><br>

                    Blockchain has emerged as a new ledger technology for data and transactions management. This
                    decentralized ledger technology relies on consensus protocols and incentive mechanisms among a
                    number of participants, i.e., miners and users, to achieve high data security and integrity.
                    However, the participants are rational and will act according to their interests. As such, game
                    theory appears to be a suitable tool to analyze and optimize the blockchain networks. In this talk,
                    we will present the basics of game theory and review some typical game models such as
                    non-cooperative game, hierarchical game, and evolutionary game that are adopted in blockchain. Then,
                    the game formulations for mining pool management, computing resource allocation, and risk management
                    in blockchain networks will be presented. Some research directions will be also discussed.<br><br>

                    and is an inventor of four US and German patents. He has authored four books including "Game Theory
                    in Wireless and Communication Networks: Theory, Models, and Applications" with Cambridge University
                    Press. He won the Best Young Researcher Award of IEEE Communications Society (ComSoc) Asia Pacific
                    (AP) and The 2011 IEEE Communications Society Fred W. Ellersick Prize Paper Award. Currently, he is
                    serving as a senior editor of IEEE Wireless Communications Letter, an area editor of IEEE
                    Transactions on Wireless Communications (Radio Management and Multiple Access), an area editor of
                    IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials (Network and Service Management and Green Communication),
                    an editor of IEEE Transactions on Communications, an associate editor of IEEE Transactions on Mobile
                    Computing, IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, and IEEE Transactions on Cognitive
                    Communications and Networking. He was a guest editor of IEEE Journal on Selected Areas on
                    Communications. He was a Distinguished Lecturer of the IEEE Communications Society for 2016-2017. He
                    was named the 2017, 2018 highly cited researcher in computer science. He is a Fellow of IEEE.
